**name:** `tdd`

**description:** Test-driven development. Use when the user wants to build features or fix bugs test-first, mentions "red-green-refactor", or wants integration tests.

# Test-Driven Development

TDD is the red → green loop. This reference makes that loop produce tests worth keeping: what a good test is, where tests go, the anti-patterns, and the rules of the loop — consult them before and during every cycle, not after. When exploring the codebase, read `CONTEXT.md` (if it exists) so test names and interface vocabulary match the project's domain language, and respect ADRs in the area.

## What a good test is

Tests verify behavior through public interfaces, not implementation details. Code can change entirely; tests shouldn't. A good test reads like a specification — "user can checkout with valid cart" states exactly what capability exists — and survives refactors because it ignores internal structure. When the public interface or test seam is itself uncertain, use the shared vocabulary in `codebase-design.md` before writing the test: the interface, not an internal helper, is the test surface. See [tests.md](tests.md) for examples and [mocking.md](mocking.md) for mocking guidelines.

## Seams — where tests go

A **seam** is the public boundary you test at: the interface where you observe behavior without reaching inside. Tests live at seams, never against internals.

**Test only at pre-agreed seams.** Before writing any test, write down the seams under test and confirm them with the user — no test at an unconfirmed seam. You can't test everything; agreeing seams up front lands testing effort on critical paths and complex logic instead of every edge case. Ask: "What's the public interface, and which seams should we test?"

## Anti-patterns

- **Implementation-coupled** — mocks internal collaborators, tests private methods, or verifies through a side channel (querying the DB instead of the interface). The tell: the test breaks on refactor with unchanged behavior.
- **Tautological** — the assertion recomputes the expected value the way the code does (`expect(add(a, b)).toBe(a + b)`; a snapshot derived the same way; a constant equal to itself), passing by construction. Expected values come from an independent source of truth — a known-good literal, a worked example, the spec.
- **Horizontal slicing** — all tests first, then all implementation. Bulk tests verify _imagined_ behavior: you test shapes rather than user-facing behavior, tests go insensitive to real changes, and you commit to test structure before understanding the implementation. Work in **vertical slices** — one test → one implementation → repeat, each test a **tracer bullet** responding to what the last cycle taught.

## Rules of the loop

- **Red before green.** Write the failing test first, then only enough code to pass it. No anticipated tests, no speculative features.
- **One slice at a time** — one seam, one test, one minimal implementation per cycle.
- **Refactoring is not part of the loop.** It belongs to the Work close-out (see the `code-review` three-axis close-out), not the red → green cycle.

# When to Mock

Mock at **system boundaries** only:

- External APIs (payment, email, etc.)
- Databases (sometimes - prefer test DB)
- Time/randomness
- File system (sometimes)

Don't mock:

- Your own classes/modules
- Internal collaborators
- Anything you control

## Designing for Mockability

At system boundaries, design interfaces that are easy to mock:

**1. Use dependency injection**

Pass external dependencies in rather than creating them internally:

```typescript
// Easy to mock
function processPayment(order, paymentClient) {
  return paymentClient.charge(order.total);
}

// Hard to mock
function processPayment(order) {
  const client = new StripeClient(process.env.STRIPE_KEY);
  return client.charge(order.total);
}
```

**2. Prefer SDK-style interfaces over generic fetchers**

Create specific functions for each external operation instead of one generic function with conditional logic:

```typescript
// GOOD: Each function is independently mockable
const api = {
  getUser: (id) => fetch(`/users/${id}`),
  getOrders: (userId) => fetch(`/users/${userId}/orders`),
  createOrder: (data) => fetch('/orders', { method: 'POST', body: data }),
};

// BAD: Mocking requires conditional logic inside the mock
const api = {
  fetch: (endpoint, options) => fetch(endpoint, options),
};
```

The SDK approach means:
- Each mock returns one specific shape
- No conditional logic in test setup
- Easier to see which endpoints a test exercises
- Type safety per endpoint

# Good and Bad Tests

## Good Tests

**Integration-style**: Test through real interfaces, not mocks of internal parts.

```typescript
// GOOD: Tests observable behavior
test("user can checkout with valid cart", async () => {
  const cart = createCart();
  cart.add(product);
  const result = await checkout(cart, paymentMethod);
  expect(result.status).toBe("confirmed");
});
```

Characteristics:

- Tests behavior users/callers care about
- Uses public API only
- Survives internal refactors
- Describes WHAT, not HOW
- One logical assertion per test

## Bad Tests

**Implementation-detail tests**: Coupled to internal structure.

```typescript
// BAD: Tests implementation details
test("checkout calls paymentService.process", async () => {
  const mockPayment = jest.mock(paymentService);
  await checkout(cart, payment);
  expect(mockPayment.process).toHaveBeenCalledWith(cart.total);
});
```

Red flags:

- Mocking internal collaborators
- Testing private methods
- Asserting on call counts/order
- Test breaks when refactoring without behavior change
- Test name describes HOW not WHAT
- Verifying through external means instead of interface

```typescript
// BAD: Bypasses interface to verify
test("createUser saves to database", async () => {
  await createUser({ name: "Alice" });
  const row = await db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ?", ["Alice"]);
  expect(row).toBeDefined();
});

// GOOD: Verifies through interface
test("createUser makes user retrievable", async () => {
  const user = await createUser({ name: "Alice" });
  const retrieved = await getUser(user.id);
  expect(retrieved.name).toBe("Alice");
});
```

**Tautological tests**: Expected value restates the implementation, so the test passes by construction.

```typescript
// BAD: Expected value is recomputed the way the code computes it
test("calculateTotal sums line items", () => {
  const items = [{ price: 10 }, { price: 5 }];
  const expected = items.reduce((sum, i) => sum + i.price, 0);
  expect(calculateTotal(items)).toBe(expected);
});

// GOOD: Expected value is an independent, known literal
test("calculateTotal sums line items", () => {
  expect(calculateTotal([{ price: 10 }, { price: 5 }])).toBe(15);
});
```
